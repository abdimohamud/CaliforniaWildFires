# CaliforniaWildFires

This is an React JS application that displays data collected from the past 10 years of wild fires that occured in the state of California. Information such as  acres burned,  start and extinguish times of the fire, fire department, and many other are included for each fire recorded. The user is able to filter through these columns as well as view a google maps widget with the radius of acre burned and an external resource to learn more about the fire.
